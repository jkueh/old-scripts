# bash_scripts
A collection of Jordan's bash scripts that he's produced over the years for a
variety of purposes.

## gifme.sh
This script was made in order to try and produce small, sharable GIFs that came
out of an NLE much faster - There's no hard and fast way to generate small GIFs
(as it does depend on the content), but this was my quick and easy way to do it.

## levels.sh
A script I made to control audio levels on systems that used amixer to control
system audio levels.
